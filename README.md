## 📝 To Do List

### 🎯 Data Collection Automation

* [ ] **Define the main data source:** (Example: [SteamCharts](https://steamcharts.com/app/529340), [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/529340/graphs/))
* [ ] **Build a web scraping script** to automatically fetch:

  * Month
  * Average Players
  * % Gain/Loss
  * Peak Players
* [ ] **Save data** in a structured format (CSV or JSON)
* [ ] (Optional) **Schedule automatic runs** (e.g., using `cron` or Windows Task Scheduler)

---

### 📊 Data Visualization

* [ ] **Add automatic annotations** for major updates and DLC releases (e.g., Update 1.5, 1.7, Pivot of Empire)
* [ ] Generate a **monthly % change chart**
* [ ] Build a **comparison chart** showing:

  * Historical peak
  * Current monthly average
  * Last 6 months trend

---

### 📈 Insights & Reporting

* [ ] Automatically generate a **textual summary** (Example: “Average players increased by X% over the last 3 months”)
* [ ] Create a **monthly PDF or HTML report** with all charts and observations
* [ ] Implement **trend forecasting models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Moving Average)

---

### 🌐 Publishing & Sharing

* [ ] Export charts as **PNG** and **SVG**
* [ ] Create a **GitHub repository** to version control data and source code

---

## ✅ Future Improvements (Ideas)

* Integrate **Steam API (real-time data)** for live player count monitoring
* Add **sentiment analysis** from Steam reviews around major updates
* Compare Victoria 3 data with **similar games (e.g., Hearts of Iron IV, Stellaris)**
* Use **Google Trends API** to compare search interest
